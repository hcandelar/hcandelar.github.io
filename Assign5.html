  <h2>The Process:</h2>

    <div class="header">

      <p>In thinking about this assignment I wanted to do something simple, but with a bit of interest. I decided 
        to start with my 2 kid’s favorite animals. A lion and a giraffe. I downloaded the files from 
        <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com">Thingiverse</a>. 
        <br><br>The lion
      </p>

      <p>The Giraffe
        
      </p> 
     
    </div>

    <div class="header">
      <p>Cute! So, next, I chopped off each of their heads… cause I’m brutal like that. This took me a bit more 
        time than I had thought. It seemed straight forward, but nothing has been straight forward with these 
        projects. I discovered I needed to create a surface and then use the [MeshBooleanSplit] to split the mesh. 
        The newly created surface is like the “knife” in cutting the pieces apart.
      </p>

    </div>

    <div class="header">
      <img src="Assign5/Assign5_Union.png" />
      <p>Next, I combined the files together to create one masterpiece. The giraffe head was in several pieces. 
        In Rhino, I went to Mesh > Boolean > Union to join the meshes together. I did this one piece at a time 
        as when I did them all together, it created chaos that I never understood!
      </p> 
    </div>

    <div class="header">
      <p>I got my new creature all together. It took some time to get the creature fully closed and in one selectable unit.
      </p>
      <img src="Assign5/Assign5_LionaffeUnion.png" />    
    </div>

    <div class="header">
      <img src="Assign5/Assign5_GiraffeFall.jpg" />  
      <p>After this step, I decided to try printing it… just to play. I realized that there could be issues with 
        the lack of supports, but wasn’t sure how to fix that, so I just went with it to see what I got. First 
        off, the ears didn’t print correctly and left me with very thin sticks that looked nothing like the 
        original mesh file. Secondly, I noticed there were definitely falls in the printing. The body was a bit 
        of a mess, and the most noticeable issue was the giraffe’s jaw. He looked like a billy goat with some 
        hairs hanging down and his jaw was droopy, but really considering I had no supports whatsoever, not too 
        bad besides the ears.
        
      </p> 
    </div>


      <br><p>I decided it would be fun to print out all 3 of my animals. The original 2 animals plus this new “lionaffe” 
        hybrid. I found this YouTube video helpful in learning about supports and how they are created and used in Cura.

      <div class="header">
        <p>I did a test print of the lion using the “normal” supports method with the lines. The finished print 
          ith the supports didn’t look pretty.

      </div>

    <div class="header">
      <img src="Assign5/Assign5_LionPrinted.jpg" />
      <p>But after peeling off the supports, it looked great, however there are a few points of contact that need 
        to be sanded down.
        
      </p> 
    </div>

    <div class="header">
      <p>Next, I tried printing the giraffe, but with the “tree” method of supports. This looked interesting when 
        it finished printing.

    </div>

  <div class="header">
    <img src="Assign5/Assign5_GiraffeEars.jpg" />
    <p>The original model was just too fragile in the limbs and easily broke off when taking off the supports. 
      I decided to just leave it broken since it really was an experiment for learning about supports. I wasn’t 
      going to reprint this goofy looking thing. Also the head looked a mess. The ears and horns were already 
      ragile in the original file, and adding the supports just made it that much worse and more fragile when 
      breaking off the supports. Oh well, this guy is a bit sad on top.

    <h1>And Lamps!</h1><br>

<h2>Inspiration:</h2>
<p>When thinking about this project, I wanted to do something that was going to be meaningful to me. I didn't what that would
  look like exactly... would that be something for my 2 young boys who love video games and who's room is decorated in a Mario themed bedroom?
  Maybe. Would that be something that I love, like purple or flowers of some type? Possibly. I knew I loved the celestial lamp that was
  posted from previous years students, but didn't want to replicate that ... well, not exactly. And I also drew inspiration by Skye's 
  <a href="https://skyeki.github.io/HCDE533/A4.html">CNC Box</a> from the last assignment. <br>
</p>

<h2>The Sketch:</h2><br>
<p> My idea was to create a pentagon shaped lamp with a celestial look. I decided to personalize the lamp by creating
  zodiac signs of my loved ones on each side. 
</p>

<img src="Assign5/Lamp/Lamp_Sketch.jpg" /><br>

<h2>The Details:</h2><br>
<p> <b>Base:</b> The base of my lamp would hold my lamp base that I purchased. There is a hole cut out from the center of the base 
  that will keep the bulb base in place and centered in the lamp. There will also be a channel with a hole out the side 
  of one of the base sides to accommadate the plug. Now that I'm writing this, I'm thinking the base might 
  need to be in 2 pieces so I can get the plug portion out of the inside of the lamp. This will need a top and bottom
  of the base that will fit together, creating a hole for the cord to run through.
  I will cut out channels in the base where the sides slide into creating the walls of the lamp.<br><br>
  <b>The Walls:</b> Each wall is for a different family member that is special to me. My mom, the Leo, my dad, the Ares, 
  my oldest son, the Gemini, my youngest son, the Pisces and myself, the Capricorn. The walls will be thin planes 
  where the zodiac sign is cut out as well as extra stars. This is where the light can shine through.<br><br>
  <b>The Lid:</b> The top of the light is a solid lid cut from the same filament as the base. It does not let the light 
  come through. It is a lid where the walls glide into channels to keep the whole piece secure and steady.

<h2>The Inards:</h2><br>
<p> The socket part that I am using came with a round base for the lamp. I am going to cut a hole in the base for this 
  round socket base to fit snugly (but not too snug!) into the base to keep sturdy.

<h2>The Question:</h2><br>
<p> <b>Corners or NO Corners!??</b> Lastly, I would like to keep this lamp simple and (hopefully) elegant. Part of me 
  thinks adding walls with channels might look nice and keep the whole lamp stronger. But another part of me thinks 
  that walls could add an extra challenge and make the whole thing look bulky and cartoonish. This will definitely 
  take some extra design work, but will I like the end result? I'm not sure. This is something I'll be looking at
  and testing to see how designing without corners looks. I don't want there to be gaps in the corners where the light 
  seeps through, but I don't want the look to be clumsy.
