  <h2>The Process:</h2>

    <div class="header">

      <p>In thinking about this assignment I wanted to do something simple, but with a bit of interest. I decided 
        to start with my 2 kid’s favorite animals. A lion and a giraffe. I downloaded the files from 
        <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com">Thingiverse</a>. 
        <br><br>The lion

      <p>The Giraffe
        
      </p> 
     
    </div>

    <div class="header">
      <p>Cute! So, next, I chopped off each of their heads… cause I’m brutal like that. This took me a bit more 
        time than I had thought. It seemed straight forward, but nothing has been straight forward with these 
        projects. I discovered I needed to create a surface and then use the [MeshBooleanSplit] to split the mesh. 
        The newly created surface is like the “knife” in cutting the pieces apart.

    <div class="header">
      <img src="Assign5/Assign5_Union.png" />
      <p>Next, I combined the files together to create one masterpiece. The giraffe head was in several pieces. 
        In Rhino, I went to Mesh > Boolean > Union to join the meshes together. I did this one piece at a time 
        as when I did them all together, it created chaos that I never understood!
      </p> 
    </div>

    <div class="header">
      <p>I got my new creature all together. It took some time to get the creature fully closed and in one selectable unit.
      </p>

    </div>

    <div class="header">
      <img src="Assign5/Assign5_GiraffeFall.jpg" />  
      <p>After this step, I decided to try printing it… just to play. I realized that there could be issues with 
        the lack of supports, but wasn’t sure how to fix that, so I just went with it to see what I got. First 
        off, the ears didn’t print correctly and left me with very thin sticks that looked nothing like the 
        original mesh file. Secondly, I noticed there were definitely falls in the printing. The body was a bit 
        of a mess, and the most noticeable issue was the giraffe’s jaw. He looked like a billy goat with some 
        hairs hanging down and his jaw was droopy, but really considering I had no supports whatsoever, not too 
        bad besides the ears.
        
      </p> 
    </div>


      <br><p>I decided it would be fun to print out all 3 of my animals. The original 2 animals plus this new “lionaffe” 
        hybrid. I found this YouTube video helpful in learning about supports and how they are created and used in Cura.

      <div class="header">
        <p>I did a test print of the lion using the “normal” supports method with the lines. The finished print 
          ith the supports didn’t look pretty.

    <div class="header">
      <img src="Assign5/Assign5_LionPrinted.jpg" />
      <p>But after peeling off the supports, it looked great, however there are a few points of contact that need 
        to be sanded down.
        
      </p> 
    </div>

    <div class="header">
      <p>Next, I tried printing the giraffe, but with the “tree” method of supports. This looked interesting when 
        it finished printing.

    <p>The original model was just too fragile in the limbs and easily broke off when taking off the supports. 
      I decided to just leave it broken since it really was an experiment for learning about supports. I wasn’t 
      going to reprint this goofy looking thing. Also the head looked a mess. The ears and horns were already 
      ragile in the original file, and adding the supports just made it that much worse and more fragile when 
      breaking off the supports. Oh well, this guy is a bit sad on top.
