  <h2>The Process:</h2>

 
  <p>TI am leaving town in 2 days for an 11 day trip for a road trip in Texas and New Mexico to see the total eclipse. 
    I have zero time to dedicate to this assignment before we leave, but I’m going to try my very best to get 
    this done before I leave.

    Unboxing my brand new Endo Pro 3 3D printer! Whoo.. look how pretty!

    The assembly of the machine went pretty smooth. I was able to follow this youtube video and set up my machine 
    in about an hour.

    The next part was where I straight up cried. I spent over 3 hours until 4am in the morning working on
    leveling out the bed of the machine. Every manual movement I made adjusted the bed so much. Several points 
    in the process, I felt like, ok, everything is leveled out. I ran the automatic leveler after doing 
    the manual adjustments and everything seemed fine.

    Here comes the real test.. I ran a test piece, and the nozzle always seemed so far away from the bed. 
    Nothing stuck to the plate, and everything just turned into a mess of strings and ran around the table. 
    I didn’t try any glue or hair spray as I felt like the nozzle was just too far from the bed, but I 
    couldn’t seem to get the nozzle placed correctly and my work to ever print correctly at all. It was a total 
    mess.

    Next, I flew to Texas for the eclipse. I would have to finish the printing once I got back to town. 
    
    I got back from my trip on Wednesday morning just after midnight. I went straight to bed and got up for my 
    9:30am class. Hopefully I’ll have time after class to do ANYTHING with this project. <br><br>
    
    Thank goodness for Wanling from the MSTI program!! She is in my morning class and was able to help me get 
    through some of the printing for this class. 
    
    I created a cube in Rhino and brought it into Cura.

    I was able to cut 3 cubes with a low, medium and high quality settings.  I next changed the setting and was
    able to cut the cube with the concentric top/bottom settings. I’m not sure 
    if the settings took or what happened, or if it’s correct, but the finished cube looks exactly the same to 
    me as the previous “triangle” settings.

    Lastly, I created a tube in Rhino. I was confused here as to what to do as I wasn’t in class to hear 
    instructions and I wasn’t sure if I needed to create a tube or a cylinder that can be cut as a tube in Cura. 
    So, this is where I ended the project. I am unfortunately out of time as I only had 3 hours from the end of 
    my first class until this assignment was due.

    I still have no idea why I couldn’t print on my own 3D printer, and am only half sure of what I’m doing as a 
    whole. My goal is to learn to do this better on my own time when I have the time this next week. I ended up 
    using the printers in the creative space in the GIX  building in Bellevue and was able to at least get 
    started with the 3D printing. <br><br>

    In the end I was not able to use my Ender Pro 3 printer.. as I can't figure out how to get it to stick to 
    the printer bed. At least not yet. I used the Ultimaker 3 that is in the Maker studios from school. I had to
    VERY quickly do this assignment and the documentation, so while it is rushed, and I did what I could under
    the constraints I had, I did the best and most I could do given the circumstances.<br><br>
