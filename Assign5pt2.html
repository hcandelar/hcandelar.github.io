  <h2>The Process:</h2>

    <div class="header">
      <img src="Assign5pt2/3DPrintWalls.jpg" />
      <p>First thing I did was make a mini model to test out my design and figure out how wide the channels 
        holding walls would need to be when printing a 3mm thick panel wall for my lamp. I had tapered the wall 
        edges to be able to get a snug fit on the walls. 
      </p> 
    </div>

    <div class="header">
      <p>While my mini model held up well, I didn't really like the look of the pentegon. So I 
        decided moving forward to change the shape to a hexagon intead.
      </p>

    </div>

    <div class="header">
      <img src="Assign5pt2/BaseModel.png" />
      <p>With a new plan, I created the model for the bass. I made sure to cut a small opening for 
        the cord to pass through.
      </p> 
    </div>

    <div class="header">
      <p>A printed the base and it only took 11 1/2 hours! 
      </p>
      <img src="Assign5pt2/BasePrintedDone.jpg" />     
    </div>

    <p> Next up was designing the panels for each wall. I used a zodiac sign of each of my family 
      memebers with lots of added stars.</p>

    <div class="header">
      <img src="Assign5pt2/NoAcrylic.jpg" />
      <p>I arrived at the Mill only to discover this sign! NO ARYCLIC ALLOWED! I went on a wild goose 
        chase to be able to cut this acrylic. I went to The 8, and they said the "shop" was closed for 
        the night. I went to Area 01, and they wanted payment. So I came back the next day to The 8, 
        and guess what... the person the day prior was wrong. The shop is closed at 6, but the laser 
        cutting was open until midnight! 
        <br><br>
        I was in The 8 for almost 8 hours cutting my acrylic! 3 different people had shifts while I was there!
      </p> 
    </div>

    <div class="header">
      <p>I needed to do some test printing for the side panels of the lamp. I started my first test 
        good, with no issues on cutting. Then, the laser stopped cutting all the way through my 
        acrylic! UGH!!
      </p>
      <img src="Assign5pt2/WallsSizeTest.jpg" />     
    </div>

    <div class="header">
      <img src="Assign5pt2/LaserCutTapeTest.jpg" />
      <p>Luckily there was someone who was from the shop there that was able to help me! He said to 
        cut faster and add another pass to my cut. When 2 passes didn't work, he said to make sure 
        they come out before I lift the acrylic. Then gave me a tip that using tape to lift the 
        pieces will let me know when the piece is fully cut! 
      </p> 
    </div>

    <div class="header">
      <p>After several test sizes, 61mm width was a perfect fit... or so it seemed!
      </p>
      <img src="Assign5pt2/Sizetest61.jpg" />     
    </div>

    <div class="header">
      <img src="Assign5pt2/AcrylicFails.jpg" />
      <p>All the fails of my actual walls. It didn't seem to hold up the same once I extended my 
        pieces to the full 8.5" length.
      </p> 
    </div>

    <div class="header">
      <p>I was running out of acrylic now and needed the next cut to fit. So, I went smaller than a 
        "perfectly tight fit", but it worked. The only issue is now the pieces are losely fit into 
        the base and it's hard to assemble the lamp. I used tape to keep the panels together while 
        I assembled the panels.

  <h2>How it's going:</h2>
  <p>So far, I have designed one side of the mold (of a mold). My brain hurt on this project trying to figure out exactly how this was coming together.
