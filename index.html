      <p>
        My name is Candelaria Herrera! <br>
        (Con-da-la-dia) <br><br>
        I'm a 1st year HCDE major. I love doing anything "crafty" and that includes learning
        new tools and skills. I'm excited to learn all the things! <br><br>
        I have an interesting background of skills. I am currently a professional photographer. I
        used to work in film. I have certificates in graphics, animation and video production. 
        I studied Industrial Engineering with a focus on CAD/CAM (but that has
        been so long ago that I'm not sure how my skills hold up any longer). And my undergrad was in 
        Interactive Media Design. Hopefully in those skill sets I can find something useful to help
        teach my classmates for this class.
