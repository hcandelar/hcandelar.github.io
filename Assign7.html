  <p>For my final project for this class, I am going to be recreating this adorable 
    <a href="https://www.eugy.com/shop/010-Elephant-p135485031" download>Eugy</a>
     elephant on a bigger scale 
    and out of wood with laser cutting. I adore elephants and wanted to create something that I would want to keep 
    long after this class. My kiddos and I have been making a few of these lately and I thought having a bigger 
    elephant out of wood would be just the perfect piece to display in my home.</p><br><br>

  <h2>The Tasks:</h2>

  <p>
    <b>Modeling:</b> I’ll recreate the elephant pieces in Adobe Illustrator using the original pieces as a reference in 
    making the Illustrator file, ready to be laser cut.<br><br>

    <b>Laser Cutting:</b> I’ll be cutting out the individual pieces out of ¼” wood. This is a new material for me to work 
  with in laser cutting.<br><br>

    <b>3D Modeling:</b> I’ll be making the eyes of the elephant out of plaster. I’ll need to create the model of the 
    mold in either Fusion 360 or Rhino.<br><br>

    <b>3D Printing: </b>I’ll be creating a mold of a mold for the eye of the elephant. This will start with the 3D 
    print and the casing for the eye.<br><br>

    <b>Casting:</b> I’ll be making a silicone mold of the elephant’s eye. And then creating 2 eyes from the plaster 
    inside my newly created silicone mold.<br><br>

    <b>Building:</b> The final step will be assembling everything and putting the whole thing together.<br><br><br>

  <h2>Contingency Plans:</h2>
  <p>
    + Test fit of wood 1st, make sure that the ears of the elphant will fit into the slots of the wood. <br>
    + If wood won't cut, I can use thinner wood, 1/8" or cardboard if even the thinner wood won't cut. <br>
    + Use beads that are already premade to cut down on casting, OR create the eyes with 3D printing instead of molding and casting.<br>
    + No sleep!
