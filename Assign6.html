  <h2>The Process:</h2>

    <div class="header">
      <img src="Assign6/OwlGraveyard.jpg" />
      <p>I had some issues with my printer not sticking when printing. No idea what happened, but all of a sudden I had 
        an owl graveyard of 3D prints.
        
      </p> 
    </div>

    <div class="header">
      <p> I switched my bed from the metal bed it came with to a glass bed. I leveled the bed again and set the Z-offset 
        based on the new bed. However, when it came time to print, the Z wasn’t going to the correct spot. It was 
        staying well above the bed and the prints were failing right from the start.<br><br>
        
        I was never able to get this corrected, however I found a work around, which was to start the print, then 
        immediately pause my print and adjust the Z-axis, then restart. I might have overcompensated and put the 
        Z-offset to -5. Normally, it was at -2.5, but it does make sense that I needed to double that setting since 
        I was starting at -2.5mm and it had no effect on the placement.

    <div class="header">

      <p>I printed my mold pieces, having my split line at the base of the owl. I created a box for each half of my 
        owl mold to fit into. 
      </p> 
    </div>

    <div class="header">
      <p>After printing the mold (for the mold) for the pour spout into the container box and it immediately got stuck. 
        I couldn’t get it out. However, when trying to decide how much silicone I would need, I filled up my 3D boxes 
        with water. The pieces floated to the top and the “stuck” piece floated up to the top! <br><br>

        I ended up needing just under 4 cups of silicone, so I used the entire mixture for making my molds.
      </p>

    <div class="header">
      <img src="Assign6/SiliconeGlassFail.jpg" />
      <p>When it came to creating my silicone, for some reason I remember hearing “silicone doesn’t stick to anything 
        but itself”. So, I used a glass measuring cup from my kitchen to save time. That didn’t work out so well, 
        and I ruined a great glass measuring cup! Kids, don't do this at home!!
      </p> 
    </div>

    <div class="header">
      <p>I poured my silicone and let it cure. I wasn’t prepared for how difficult it would be to remove the silicone 
        mold from the container. 
      </p>
      <img src="Assign6/SiliconeCasting.jpg" />     
    </div>

    <div class="header">
      <img src="Assign6/MoldMakingAftermath.jpg" />
      <p>Because the silicone was so thick, I wasn’t able to get the mold out of the container. I used some pliers and 
        snipped at the box until I was able to remove the silicone out of the container. <br><br>

        This was the aftermath of getting the molds out of the boxes! 
      </p> 
    </div>

    <div class="header">
      <p>Now I was left with my beautiful silicone molds! They are surprisingly heavy!
      </p>
      <img src="Assign6/SiliconeMoldFinished.jpg" />     
    </div>

    <div class="header">
      <img src="Assign6/PlasterPour.jpg" />
      <p>For the plaster, I used plastic disposable cups to stir the plaster. 3 parts plaster to 1 part water! 
        And poured the plaster into the 2 part mold.
      </p> 
    </div>

    <div class="header">
      <p>I found some cheap MDF 5x5” ⅛” thick boards at the craft store to use for strength on each end of the molds.<br><br> 

        After pouring the plaster into the mold and using the boards on each side, I secured the mold together with 
        about 10 rubber bands! I wanted to make sure the seal was tight.
        
      </p>

    </div>

    <div class="header">
      <img src="Assign6/CastingInMold.jpg" />
      <p>After an hour, I returned to my mold to remove the silicone casing. The top came off easily and I was left 
        with a “handle” of sorts to pull out the owl. Then was able to break off that cone after getting the owl out 
        of the mold. 
      </p> 
    </div>

    <div class="header">
      <p>I call this "birthing an owl". <br><br>
        I was left with a beautiful owl! There were more air bubbles in the owl than I would like, but I was able to 
        replicate my owl. I only ended up with 3 castings since I ran out of plaster for a 4th owl.
