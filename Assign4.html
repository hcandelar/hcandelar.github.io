  <h2>The Process:</h2>

      <p>My first step this week was to get my own 3D printer to work! I left my on my road trip without being 
        able to successfully print on my personal 3D printer. So, tackling that was the first step in this week’s 
        project. Luckily, after watching and following the posted bed leveling YouTube videos, I was able to make 
        the necessary adjustments to the gcode to get my bed to print correctly. A rabbit.. Success!

      <p>Next up was tackling the assignment and making a cube. I decided I wanted to go “simple” with this cube 
        and did all 4 sides the exact same. So, they would fit into one another. This actually came up 
        accidentally when I was testing the fittings of the pieces. I decided to have the tabs on one edge of the 
        flat side of the cube, and the cutouts on the other side. This was just to test the fit and what adjustments 
        needed to be made. In my first attempt, I started with a 5mm x 5mm tab / cut hole and did multiple instances 
        to make sure the dimensions were correct.

    <div class="header">
      <img src="Assign4/Assign4_CubeAttempt1.jpg" />
      <p>I noticed that the first attempt, was nowhere near fitting. The tabs were too big and the holes were too 
        small. I also printed the first attempt as 3mm thick, and it seemed excessive. 
      </p> 
    </div>

    <div class="header">
      <p>In my second attempt, I measured the printed tab size and the tab hole, and found the difference. From 
        here, I split the difference in half and used that measurement to adjust the tab/cut size of the hole, 
        giving a narrower tab and a wider hole. <br><br>
        I also adjusted the thickness of my walls to only 2mm thick. Then adjusted the boxes to cut from to 
        only 2.5mm wide to adjust for the new thickness of the walls. With my new measurements, I jumped to 5.5mm 
        wide of a (tab) hole. In this attempt, the walls actually fit together “perfectly”. As in, they were flush 
        and perfect, but had zero friction and did not stay together at all. Fail.

      <p>Finally, after 5ish attempts I got the right fit. I adjusted the hole cut size to 5.25mm. I’m not sure 
        what the tab size was exactly, as I was adjusting the cut hole and recentering it around the empty 
        space, controlling the cut hole, but not directly adjusting the sizing for the tabs themselves.<br><br>

        A measurement of 5.25mm snapped together perfectly and a nice fit.

    <div class="header">
      <p>I went ahead and added in the top and bottom holes, and went for it. I figured at this point it would 
        be easy to simply adjust the 1 setting for the top / bottom panel if any adjustments needed to be made.

    <div class="header">
      <img src="Assign4/Assign4_Top-Bottom.jpg" />
      <p>Next, I created the top / bottom panels. Of course, the fit wasn’t quite right and was a bit too tight. <br><br> 

        I adjusted the tab size, and on my 2nd attempt it was a perfectly tight fit. It snapped together with a
        bit of force.

      <h2>Helpful Tip!</h2>
      <p>

      Alcohol wipes are NOT enough to clean the bed and have any usefulness. I used the little swabs and got zero 
      adhesion results from the swabs. I even (once) tried glue, and still it did not fix the adhesion issues 
      I was having! Finally, I said, well, I’ll try a whole bottom cap full of rubbing alcohol and see if that 
      helps. It did indeed fix my adhesion problem. It might be overkill, but from that point forward, I was 
      using a full bottle cap before EVERY single new print!<br><br>

      Turning the nozzle heat up to 208 degrees also helped my project. I was having problems with the item 
      started well on the bed, then after many layers, it would slide around and no longer stick to the bed. 
      Adjusting the nozzle a little combined with the cap full of rubbing alcohol seems to have stopped this 
      issue… crossing my fingers it keeps that way!
