  <h2>The Process:</h2>

      <p>The first issue I ran into on this project was that my cardboard was very inconsistent. 
        I had bought sheets of cardboard from Amazon, and from the packaging warping the edges and the 
        squishiness of the boards, each side of the cardboard came out different. I took measurements of 
        all 4 sides and then averaged them to get an average thickness of 3.68mm.

      <p>After getting an average thickness of my cardboard, I created a test piece. I did cutouts from 
        3.5mm to 4.3mm. The larger sizes of 4.0 and bigger were very loose and didnâ€™t pass the shake test. 
        The smallest 3 sizes were all acceptable sizes and passed the shake test, however I went with the 
        smallest and tightest size so the finished project would really hold up under a firm shake. 
        The pieces fit together nicely, but were snug that the structure would be sturdy.
